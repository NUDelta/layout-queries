# Pattern Matching
A project built to help learning front-end developers build complex front-end components
better, faster, and with more confidence. The Pattern Matching system seeks to do this by
presenting the user with relevant professional examples of front-end components that are
each paired with a video recording that displays an interaction with the component.
Synchronized with that recording is also a timeline of the front-end code function calls
facilitating the componentâ€™s lifecycle.
